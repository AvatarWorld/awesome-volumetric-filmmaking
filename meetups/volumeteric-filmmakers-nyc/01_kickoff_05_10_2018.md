SPEAKER BIOS / PRESENTATIONS:  
**James George, CEO / [Scatter](https://www.scatter.nyc)**

James George is the Co-Creator of Depthkit and CEO and Co-Founder of Scatter, a company dedicated to defining the emerging language of Volumetric Filmmaking through original stories, creative tools and community. Prior to Scatter, James worked as a media artist exhibiting interactive films and installations at venues such as the MoMA in New York, Ars Electronica, ZKM, Sundance and the Tribeca Film Festival. He was the first artist in residence at Microsoft Research in Redmond.

Presentation:

James will discuss the history and future of Volumetric Filmmaking; A survey exploration into how immersive reality formats have inspired an entirely new creative discipline at the intersection of film, games and theater. The trends that have lead up to the current explosion in volumetric capture speaks to the opportunities and challenges that lay ahead.

**Illya Szilak, Co-Creator / [Queerskins](http://vr.queerskins.com/), 2018 Tribeca Film Festival**

Illya Szilak is an interactive storyteller and practicing physician. Her longtime creative partner is Cyril Tsiboulski (Cloudred Studio). Both their online multimedia narratives Reconstructing Mayakovsky (2008) and Queerskins (2013) are archived in The Electronic Literature Collection. Their first Volumetric Film Queerskins: a love story premiered at The TriBeCa Film Festival 2018. This cinematic haptic experience takes visitors on a magical realist journey down a Missouri country road. Seated behind two devoutly Catholic parents, visitors get to know their estranged son lost to AIDS. Their are also currently in production on another volumetric project, Atomic Vacation.

Presentation:

Fresh from it’s run at the 2018 TriBeCa Film Festival, Illya will discuss the creative challenges in bringing Queerskins to life, and her technical team’s approach to volumetric capture & post-production.
