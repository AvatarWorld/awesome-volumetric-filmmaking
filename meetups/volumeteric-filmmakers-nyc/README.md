(Taken from [the Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/VolumetricFilmmakersNYC))

Have you heard about Volumetric Capture, Production & Post-Production for VR, AR & Immersive Media and want to know more?

Are you a creator already engaged in creating volumetric video?

We invite anyone curious or familiar with this emerging technology / artform to join our meetup and learn how it can expand their creative horizons!

We aim to provide a forum for all types of creators to come together to discuss and learn about volumetric filmmaking and immersive technology.

Join a diverse community of creators, trailblazers, filmmakers, developers and artists who want to better understand the intersection of storytelling and immersive technology.

People from all disciplines are encouraged to join and help us in this mission!
