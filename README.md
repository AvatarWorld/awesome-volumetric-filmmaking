# Awesome Volumetric Filmmaking List
A curated resource for all things pertaining to volumetric filmmaking.

This list is meant to share projects, resources, software, tutorials, meetups, hardware and more, all related to the practice and craft of volumetric filmmaking.

## What is Volumetric Filmmaking?
Volumetric Filmmaking is a growing movement in immersive (AR/VR/MR) content characterized by interactive experiences created using predominantly 3D scanned imagery, such as volumetric video and photogrammetry, in conjunction with game engines to enable viewer agency within reconstructed lifelike environments.

A true hybrid of video games and cinema, volumetric filmmaking draws inspiration from related creative disciplines, most notably documentary film, immersive theater, cinematic 360 virtual reality, interactive installations, choose-your-own-adventure books, walking simulator games, and generative art.

Volumetric films commonly include magical realism, futurism, dreamworlds and cyberpunk themes and references.
